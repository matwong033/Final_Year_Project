# Final_Year_Project

Hello, welcome to my Final Year Project file uploads. This repo documents my work in the past year (starting in late 2024), on researching the optical characteristics of nanostructures. 

Specifically, my project focuses on looking at the photoactivity anomalies seen in Platinum (Pt) and Gold (Au) nanostructures. To simplify our research scope, we delve into studying perfectly-spherical nanoparticles, however, the codebase used for the project can be applied for nanostructures of various, arbitrary shapes and form. 

Pt is a less well-studied optical material than Au, which prompted my dedication into finding out the potential of Pt applications in photonic devices (nanomaterial-incoporated LED/OLEDs, quantum dots, diodes, sensors), to general and fundamental electronics (transistors, CMOS, "quantum" integrated circuits). Advanced applications would then include quantum computers, high performance compute resources, CPU/GPU/QPU chips in which incorporating nanomaterials would drastically alter design and innovation possibilities. 

Photons are a fun unit of energy. They are probabilistic yet quantitized in energy, and quasiparticles with close relations to electrons. This reminds me highly of stochastic processes and the strangeness of statistics in quantum mechanics, which is my most loved realm of materials science/physics. This project is not only highly computational and quantitative, it is also a strong proof of endeavour into understanding the world and explaining phenomena with theories. 

Uploaded are some code snippets used in my project, and attached are illistrations of my work. Feel free to contact me for any suggestions/ideas on further work, or to collab!
